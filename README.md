# Redi's Discord Bot Repository

Hello! Welcome to my DBM Repository,

I assume you're here for that raw data yas? Well of course!

This repository contains and stores all Raw Data packages created by Redi Panda_#3657.

All RD Packages are available and free for users to edit, **HOWEVER;**

*If you plan to redistribute and/or publish these RD, you must acquire permission from me and credit/link back to this repository. I hate it when people "create" content
then claim it as "their" work.*

*You are also allowed to do slight modifications/revamps to these RD Packages if these do get outdated (Requiring permission), however please contact
me before editing these packages in case I already got update plans for them.*

> Failure to comply to those following policies set from this README document will result getting reported straight to the DBM Network. We do not condone users to plagerise work with Raw Data. Again, you are **free** to edit the contents to your liking, but _**distributing**_ the packages, *EDITED OR NOT EDITED* without permission is not permitted.

> Also, by using my packages, you agree to all the terms stated in this document. These terms can change at any time, however any **significant** changes will be attempted to be clear and noticeable as possible.

**Thank you for your understanding and don't forget to vote these RD Packages so that I can continue to make more packages for the community.**

_**Any problems that persists, please don't hesitate to contact my Discord. I'm online on a daily basis, however if I don't contact back, I'm probably
on vacation. So please bear in mind that I also have a life as well :)**_
